# Simple-Self-Discord-bot
A very simple discord bot I made in Python.

I utilized some free public APIs to add useful features by a simple command.
(Most of the APIs are already closed for free/public use and therefore need to be replaced).

There are 3 executable files that need to be present in the folder together with the main.py file:
- ffmpeg.exe
- ffplay.exe
- ffprobe.exe
The purpose is to be able to play music with your own discord account.
